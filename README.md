## Update
We made a little update since the first lab. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr6IzOGoMsQ) is a video explaining how to make a contribution (a pull-request) to someone's repository.

## Step 1
<s>Clone</s> Fork this repository

## Step 2
After <s>cloning</s> forking this repository, you will create a folder `team-name` where you will write a `team-name.md` MARKDOWN file (`team-name` being the name of your team).
Your file must contain the following PRELIMINARY components:
* Members of your team (name, email, github profile);
* Name of your IoT product;
* A description of your IoT product (A problematic you are targeting, your solution, market you are targeting, etc.). **A paragraph of about 200 words should be fine**;
* A preliminary list of components that you think appropriate;
* [Optional] Any document that you find related to your project. These have to be put under a folder `team-name/resources/`;

This first step is very important and require, from you, a little work of research. Try to get inspired by what is done currently in the market (FabLabs, CES 2019, etc.).

## Step 3
You have until Sunday, January 2Oth (23h59) to fill a **pull-request** containing your proposition in this repository.

## Step 4
An approval (or enhancement) will be issued by us.

## Step 5
We will create, for you, a repository in `Institut Galilée - IoT` organization page.
We will follow your developments (commits, issues, discussions, etc.) and the more active you are, the more you get good appreciations for your final mark.
